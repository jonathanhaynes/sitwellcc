  <p>Wednesday evening rides depart from the corner of Turner Lane and High Street, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ArXDRXnkWEr">Whiston</a> at 7:30pm prompt.</p>
  <p>Wednesday club rides are much shorter than a Sunday ride, we will be on the road for around 1 and a half hours riding at about 13-14mph.</p>
  <p>When the weather is better in the Summer months we may nip to the pub afterwards for cheeky half.</p>
