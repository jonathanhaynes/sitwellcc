    <p>As we currently don't have the facilities to provide a traffic-free environment, junior membership is open to children from as young as 12 as long as they attend with a parent or guardian.</p>

    <p>In line with guidance from our governing body, British Cycling, we can currently offer the following:</p>

    <h3>12-13</h3>
  <p>12-13 year olds can attend any of our Wednesday evening and Saturday morning rides as these are shorter and of a more leisurely pace. Which is ideal for younger members.</p>

  <h3>14+</h3>
  <p>If your child is 14 or older then they can attend all of the rides we offer including our Sunday morning rides which are usually around 50 miles in length.</p>

  <h3>16+</h3>
  <p>If your child is 16 or older then they can attend without a parent or guardian being present.</p>

  <h2 id="welfare">Welfare</h2>

  <p>We do have to point out that although we do have Welfare Officers in the club who are DBS checked. They may not be present on all rides. However, there will be no point on any ride that your child is left alone with one adult.</p>

  <h2 id="memberships">Memberships</h2>

  <p>If this interests you or your child we have <a href="/membership">more information on memberships here</a>.</p>

  <p>Or feel free to come along on one of our rides. There's <a href="/club-rides">more on that here</a>.</p>
