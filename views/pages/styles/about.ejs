  <p>Rotherham's newest cycle club serving Whiston, Rotherham and the surrounding areas.</p>

  <p>Founded January 2016 after a bunch of mates decided they'd like to join a club that was for the good times with a little bit of racing too and felt there wasn't one in the vicinity that met their needs.</p>

  <p>We're a not-for-profit, volunteer run organisation registered to <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/club/profile/7596/sitwell-cc">British Cycling</a> - affiliation number: 537309.</p>

  <p>Primarily a social cycling club, our core activity is the <a href="/club-rides/">Sunday Club Ride</a>. We also meet on a Wednesday evening too.</p>

  <p>At now 20 members strong, we're growing steadily, so come and give us a try - no obligation to join unless you enjoy your ride with us enough to make you want to repeat the experience.</p>

  <p>Whether you are a beginner, returning competitive cyclist or triathlete looking to improve your cycling performance Sitwell Cycling Club will provide you a warm and friendly welcome, whatever your age.</p>
  
  <p><a href="/membership">Membership applications</a> are available on the site as well as a guide to <a href="/club-rides">upcoming rides</a>, we look forward to meeting you at the next Sitwell CC event.</p>
